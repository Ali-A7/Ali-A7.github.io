**About Me**

I am an AI researcher and robotics engineer working at the intersection of machine learning, multimodal intelligence, and real-world autonomous systems, with experience spanning both academic research and industrial applications in robotics and healthcare. My work focuses on developing learning-based methods that connect perception, reasoning, and decision-making, enabling intelligent systems to operate robustly in complex environments and generate practical impact across technology and life sciences.

I am currently a research engineer at ISIR (Institut des Systèmes Intelligents et de Robotique) at Sorbonne University, one of the leading robotics laboratories in Europe. There, I work on vision-language models for robotic perception and social navigation, contributing to the development of multimodal architectures that allow robots to interpret and interact with dynamic human environments. This work sits at the frontier between embodied AI, multimodal learning, and autonomous systems.

I completed the prestigious Master MVA (Mathematics, Vision, Learning) at ENS Paris-Saclay as an Erasmus student, following an MSc in ICT Engineering from the University of Padova (Italy) and a Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering. My interdisciplinary background in engineering and artificial intelligence has provided a strong foundation for research across reinforcement learning, control systems, computer vision, and representation learning. During my master’s research, I worked on reinforcement learning for exoskeleton control, developing simulation environments and policy optimization strategies for stable learned control.

Alongside academic research, I gained industry experience at Sanofi within the Biomarker and Data Sciences group, where I developed machine learning pipelines for biomedical image analysis and feature extraction from large-scale microscopy data. This experience significantly shaped my interest in applying AI to healthcare and pharmaceutical research, particularly in problems involving multimodal biological data and decision-support systems.

Earlier in my career, I worked as a teaching assistant in programming and also as a freelance developer, experiences that strengthened my technical communication skills and practical software engineering abilities. Having studied and worked across multiple countries — including Iran, Italy, and France — I have developed a strong international perspective and adaptability within diverse research and professional environments.

My research interests lie broadly in multimodal AI, intelligent agents, reinforcement learning, robotics, and machine learning for scientific and medical applications. I am particularly interested in approaches that bridge embodied intelligence with real-world impact, whether through autonomous robotic systems or AI methods that accelerate discovery in healthcare and life sciences.

I am currently seeking fully funded PhD opportunities starting in 2026–2027 in Paris or London, ideally within industrial or collaborative research environments that connect academia with leading technology or pharmaceutical organizations. I am especially motivated by industrial PhD programmes and projects at the intersection of AI with robotics, healthcare, or scientific discovery, where research can translate into tangible real-world applications.
