Projects
======

- **Master Thesis — PPO RL for Exoskeleton Control (2024)**  
  Built an LSTM-based learned simulator and trained a PPO agent; improved stability via episode design, action constraints, and reward shaping. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

- **Sanofi — Microscopy ROI Analysis Pipeline (2025)**  
  Built a modular Python pipeline for ROI-based microscopy image analysis on large datasets; automated analysis and visualization of multi-channel QPTIFF slides. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

- **Transformer-based OCR (ENS Paris-Saclay, 2024)**  
  Explored TrOCR for image-to-text conversion using transformer-based vision-language architectures. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

- **Kaggle — Lymphocytosis Classification**  
  Compared CNN and RNN models for malignancy detection in hematological data. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

- **Kaggle — Generative AI Style Transfer**  
  Applied GAN-based methods to transfer artistic styles using Claude Monet paintings. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

- **LLM Fine-Tuning Research**  
  Studying LoRA, RAG, and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) for scalable adaptation of LLMs. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
