Projects
======

- **Master Thesis — PPO RL for Exoskeleton Control (2024)**  
  Built an LSTM-based learned simulator and trained a PPO agent; improved stability via episode design, action constraints, and reward shaping. 

- **Sanofi — Microscopy ROI Analysis Pipeline (2025)**  
  Built a modular Python pipeline for ROI-based microscopy image analysis on large datasets; automated analysis and visualization of multi-channel QPTIFF slides. 

- **Transformer-based OCR (ENS Paris-Saclay, 2024)**  
  Explored TrOCR for image-to-text conversion using transformer-based vision-language architectures. 

- **Kaggle — Lymphocytosis Classification**  
  Compared CNN and RNN models for malignancy detection in hematological data.

- **Kaggle — Generative AI Style Transfer**  
  Applied GAN-based methods to transfer artistic styles using Claude Monet paintings.

- **LLM Fine-Tuning Research**  
  Studying LoRA, RAG, and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) for scalable adaptation of LLMs.

- **Medical IoT Device (Bachelor thesis)**  
  Designed a wireless temperature sensor system with embedded data acquisition and real-time monitoring.
